# Hello-Microverse-Project
In this project, you will set up a "Hello world" repository.


## Built With

- HTML & CSS


## Getting Started

**This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.**
**Modify this file to match your project, remove sections that don't apply. For example: delete the testing section if the currect project doesn't require testing.**


To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Setup
- Create a repository
- Create a new branch 
- Add a .gitignore file.
- Set up a linter for HTML and CSS and make sure that any files that are not relevant are ignored by git.
- Add descriptive README file to your project.
- Add 3 files (each one in a separate commit):
     A .html file that includes a header with the text "Hello Microverse!". Use h1 tag for that.
     A .css file that includes one class with styles for your header (make it in your favorite color).
     A test.md file with the text "This file should be ignored by git".
- Make sure that the last file is actually ignored by git and is not present in your GitHub repository.
